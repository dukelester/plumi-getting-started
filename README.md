# Pulumi

Pulumi is an open source infrastructure as code tool for creating, deploying, and managing cloud infrastructure. Pulumi works with traditional infrastructures like VMs, networks, and databases, in addition to modern architectures, including containers, Kubernetes clusters, and serverless functions. Pulumi supports 70+ public, private, and hybrid cloud service providers.

## Why Pulumi?

By using familiar languages for infrastructure as code, you get many benefits: IDEs, abstractions including functions, classes, and packages, existing debugging and testing tools, and more. The result is greater productivity with far less copy and paste, and it works the same way no matter which cloud you're targeting.
